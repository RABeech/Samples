				Between the popularity of movements like minimalism and Chi Running, more people than ever are trying to 	fix their running form in the hope of eliminating injuries and getting faster. Each school of running form has its converts who swear it’s the miracle cure. Experts say there’s not enough research to definitively say that any of these methods prevent—or cause—injuries. One thing is for sure: Try to make a radical change to your form suddenly, without giving your body a chance to adjust, and you’ll end up injured. So how do you determine whether your form needs fixing? As long as you’re running comfortably and injury-free, there’s no reason to believe it does.<br><br>
				Your running mechanics are determined by the strength and flexibility of certain muscles and how your body is built. Here are a few basics to help you maintain proper running form on any terrain

			<ul class="tech_liststyle">
				<li><strong>Maintain a short, quick stride.</strong><span> Do not try to lengthen your stride; avoid reaching forward with your foot, which can lead to overstriding and will set you up for injury.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Keep your knee in line.</strong><span> Make sure your foot strikes under your knee, not in front of it, which can lead to injury. It doesn’t matter whether the heel or forefoot hits the ground first, as long as your foot is not in front of your knee. This is especially important when running downhill.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Push up and off.</strong><span> Focus on pushing up and off the ground behind you.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Watch your elbows.</strong><span> Keep your elbows bent at 90 degrees or less.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Relax your hands. </strong><span>Keep hands loose and below your chest. Make sure your hands don’t cross your midline and your hands don’t punch forward, both of which can throw off your gait. Pay careful attention to this when you’re carrying something like a music player or a dog leash. Switch hands halfway through the workout if possible.</span></li>
				<li><strong>Work your core.</strong><span> When starting a running program, it is also a great time to start working on your core strength, particularly your glutes and abdominal muscles.  A strong core makes it easier to stay upright—even when you’re tired—and avoid leaning too far forward from your hip, which can lead to injury.</span></li>
